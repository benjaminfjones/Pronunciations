# Pronunciations

This project is a parser and algebraic datatype representation for the pronunciations from the CMU pronouncing dictionary. It also contains two executables:

`pronunciations`: a simple homophone REPL to demonstrate functionality.

`portmanteau`: a tool to find phonetic portmanteaus.


The CMU pronouncing dictionary may be downloaded here: <http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict.0.7a>.

# Pronunciations

This project is a parser and algebraic datatype representation for the pronunciations from the CMU pronouncing dictionary, as well as a simple homophone REPL to demonstrate its functionality.

The CMU pronouncing dictionary may be downloaded here: <http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict-0.7b>.
